# imfdb Exploratory Data Analysis


---

## The sort of data I'd use:
imfdb (Internet Movie Firearms Database) is a big wiki that records the appearance of specific models of firearms in various media. 
The sort of data I would be able to get directly from the website would be: Firearm Name, Firearm Type, Media Title it appears in.

## Process:

1. Figure out how extract a large dataset from a wiki

2. Import and clean up
 
3. Categorize firearm by manufacturer and model (based on firearm name)

4. Categorize by movie/media title (based on wiki page name)

5. Categorize by firearm "type" (handgun, revolver, shotgun, etc.) (based on content headers)

Extra (these would be a lot of extra work):
 - Categorize by media genre 
 based on wiki page category somehow? Would take multiple steps, and I might need to compare the movie name through a separate database.
 
- Categorize by firearm creation year 
Would be easy for guns that include the year in their name, though I would need to use a separate database for guns without a year in their name.
Also, what if there is some weird gun with a four digit number in their name that isn't the creation year?

## Why this?
Pros:
- Dataset is amateur so would probably be messy.
- Instead of being made up of mostly numbers and measurements, it's a bunch unorganized categories and names. So I think that's interesting.
Cons:
- I'd have to figure out how to extract a database from elements of a website, which might be well beyond the purpose of this assignment.
- I just don't really like guns to be honest, but the data's interesting enough I don't mind it.
